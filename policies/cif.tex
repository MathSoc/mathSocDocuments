\section{Capital Improvements Fund}
\emph{effective September 1, 2020; replaces December 6, 2011}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the Capital Improvements Fund shall be to fund lasting capital improvements to student space in the Math Faculty, as well as any special project funds allocated by Council.

\subsection{Fund}
Each term, seventeen and a half percent (17.5\%) of the student fee going towards the 
Society (after math\textbf{\textsf{NEWS}}' portion is deducted) for each fee-paying member of the 
Society shall be allocated to the Fund.

\subsection{Special Project Funds}
From time to time Council may allocate funds for special projects. Council may outline a new funding priority for any special project fund as an alternative to section 4.

\subsection{Priority of Funding}
At the discretion of Council, proposals shall be given priority in the following decreasing order:\
\begin{itemize}
\item Improvements to Society offices, Lounges and the Math Coffee and Donut Shop;
\item Improvements to the offices of recognised Clubs;
\item Improvements to the offices of affiliates including math\textbf{\textsf{NEWS}}, Math Graduation Committee, and Math Orientation Committee; and
\item Other projects that the committee feels fulfill the purpose of the Fund.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
Appropriate application forms shall be made available on the MathSoc Website. The Vice
President, Finance will be responsible in bringing forth any submission to Council 
at the next regularly scheduled Council meeting. The applicants must present their 
proposals to Council to be considered for funding. Council is responsible to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Entertain presentations for each proposal, and
\item Approve or deny, some or all of, the requested funding.
\end{itemize}
If Council approves more than \$5,000, the Board of Directors must review and ratify 
the decision. The Board will not unreasonably deny ratification.

\subsection{Over Budget}
The Executive Committee of MathSoc is responsible for ensuring that the project is 
completed within 120\% of the amount approved by the council. If the funding is 20\% 
less than the actual spent as well as under \$1000, the Executive Committee and the 
Business Manager can approve the payment of the project and will inform the Council 
and Board about this at the next regular meeting. 

\subsection{MathSoc Visibility}
All projects funded by the Capital Improvements Fund must include a visible logo or phrase that is in the spirit
of ``Funded by the Capital Improvements Fund of the Mathematics Society'' either written in 
content or physically placed on the capital items purchased. If the project is 
online-based, the logo shall be placed under a ``Sponsors'' section at the prime location 
of the funded page.
