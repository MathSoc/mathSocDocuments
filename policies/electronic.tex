\subsection{Newsgroups}
The society recognizes the following two newsgroups for the purposes described below.
The newsgroup uw.math.ugrad exists for undergraduate mathematics students to discuss general issues and concerns. It also provides a forum for Society announcements, and a mechanism for feedback.
The newsgroup uw.math.mathsoc exists as a communication channel between Society volunteers. Posts should be restricted to operational concerns of the Society; i.e. announcements of Board meetings, training sessions, etc.

\subsection{MathSoc Mailing Lists}
The Society may in its operations make use of mailing lists to aid in the operations of the Society. Messages to the mailing list should be restricted to the mandate of the mailing list. The operator of a MathSoc mailing list may take action to ensure that all use of the mailing list is restricted to its mandate.

\subsection{MFCF Mailing List}
The Society has available to it the use of a mailing list for all undergraduate students registered in the Faculty of Mathematics, administered by MFCF. The following restrictions apply to messages sent via this mailing list:
