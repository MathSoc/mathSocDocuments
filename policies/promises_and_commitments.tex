\section{Promises and Commitments}
No body of the society or any club under MathSoc will promise or commit any goods, service or compensation of any kind to anyone without having all the logistics finalized or funds approved by the appropriate bodies in accordance with the governing documents of the society and if applicable, the specific club constitution. 
A body of MathSoc may approve a project and begin work on said project, but may not promise or commit any goods, service or compensation until the logistics surrounding it's implementation are finalized. 

MathSoc will not be liable to fulfill any such commitment without documentation showing that logistics were finalized or funds approved before said commitment was made.

This policy shall only apply to commitments with a cost of at least \$3000. For amounts less than this, a reasonable effort shall be made to comply with this policy, but this policy will not restrict these commitments.
