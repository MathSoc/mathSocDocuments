As far back as I have heard of, which is quite a ways into the past, there have
been a few constants around the third floor of the Math \& Computer building.
An unhealthy obsession for the colour pink emanating from the office in the
southeast corner. A strained relationship with the Computer Science Club across
the hall. A fornightly (not biweekly, please!) newspaper of questionable quality
and unquestionably lax editorial policies that redeems itself by publishing
funny quotations from professors, especially Larry Smith in economics.

And as far as I know, MathSoc has always called itself MathSoc. There was a
dabbling in the early 2000s (and possibly farther back) of two
mostly-independent societies, X, and Y, which alternated from term to term much
as EngSoc A and B do today. The intent was to make it easier for co-op students
(and anyone who looks at EngSoc's governance will understand why; it works very
 well for them), but the nontrivial portion of regular students in the Faculty
makes for difficult work.

The full name of the Society shall be ``The Mathematics Society of the University
of Waterloo''; its short name shall be ``MathSoc''.
