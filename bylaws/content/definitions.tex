\section{Definitions}

\begin{annotation}
This section, perhaps, has a few more definitions than are strictly necessary. A
few of the definitions deserver further comment, though.

The ``academic year'' as defined by the University is presently from September
to August. This is different from the fiscal year of all major organizations on
campus, which extends from May to April. This causes some difficulties, from
time to time. In practice, MathSoc takes a year to be whatever is convenient at
the time, because a year is a long time for undergrads.

The word ``term'' is highly overloaded, and this is unfortunate. It can mean
both the term of office of someone in a position, and of course the academic
term about 4 months long. Often you want to use both meanings in the same
sentence. There is no particularly good substitute in other case, because the
word ``tetramester'' hasn't really caught on. Often, the correct meaning needs
to be inferred from context.

The definition of a term here indirectly sets the term of office of Council and
of the Executive. This rarely matters, as good Executive tend to star early and
end late, but it does affect things like who gets invited to Orientation Week
events. It also would affect Council membership, should an emergency arise right
at a term boundary and action need to be taken quickly.

The definitions of ``student'' and ``math student'' are carefully written to be
as inclusive as possible. It seems that the University administration is always
inventing creative ways to blend programs across faculties and institutions,
such as the Double Degree programs with Laurier. Interestingly enough, this
does include students who are out of reach of UW at faraway institutions and who
are on exchange.

The definition of ``first-year student'' is similarly broad, and the intent here
is simply to ensure that when we get a list of first-years from the Registrar's
Office to put into our voter lists, it matches up with our definition of
first-year. The most notable case where a student is first-year but not in first
year is when a student fails enough courses that they fail to advance to 2A, as
your term of study in the Math Faculty is determined entirely by credits.

The final paragraphs of this article, relating to non-voting members and
appointments, are rules that exist just so that this case is covered, and not
because there is any particularly good reason for one version of a rule over
another. In particular, the fact that non-voting members cannot make motions is
rather arbitrary, and the rules for appointments just ensure that someone cannot
show up claiming to be a representative without authority (for my thoughts on
that, however, see the later section on non-voting members of Council!).
