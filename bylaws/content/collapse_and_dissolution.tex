%%COLLAPSE (l)
\section{Collapse \& Dissolution}
The Society shall be deemed to be collapsed if, for a period of at least seven
months, no quorate meeting of Council, the Board of Directors, or a general
meeting is held.

In the event of a collapse, then notwithstanding the rest of this document, any
voting member may call a general meeting, and this meeting has the power to
appoint persons directly to the Board of Directors, the Executive Board, and to
Council for the current term. It can remove people from their office but it
cannot appoint someone to an office for which they are not eligible.

If no quorate meeting of Council, the Board of Directors, or a general meeting
is held for fourteen months, the Society shall dissolve. Otherwise, the Society
can dissolve only by referendum.  In the event that the Society dissolves, all
of its assets shall go to the Federation, to be used for the establishment of a
new society for students of the Faculty or to otherwise benefit the students of
the Faculty.
