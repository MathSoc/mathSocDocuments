\section{Non-Director Chair Permission}
\emph{effective 2020}\\

In the case that the Chair of the Board is not a director, the Board may grant special permission to the Chair to allow the individual to second a proposed motion.
This permission prevents long gaps to wait for a seconder and ensures smoother meeting execution.
