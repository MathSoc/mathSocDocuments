\section{Key Distribution}
\emph{effective August 19, 2018}\\

The distribution of keys/fobs to any offices controlled by the Society must be
approved in writing by the President or the Business Manager before
approval from the Faculty is sought. The Business Manager shall act
as key controller for the Society. Executive Officers of the Society shall not
be allowed to sign out their own keys/fobs. Authority for keys/fobs is granted
by the Faculty, and keys/fobs may be refused by the Faculty even if authorized
by MathSoc.

Keys/fobs must be returned to the Faculty before or on the date indicated on
the form used to obtain the key/fob. Upon resignation of any key-holding
position within the Society, the permit for the keys associated with this
position expires immediately, and the keys/fobs shall be immediately and
properly returned. If any evidence of misuse by an individual has occurred, as
determined by the Executive Board or the Faculty, all keys/fobs must be
returned immediately to the Faculty. Any individual who fails to return all of
their keys/fobs on time will not be permitted to hold any keys/fobs controlled
by the Society for a period of 8 months; this may be appealed at the Board of 
Diretors.
