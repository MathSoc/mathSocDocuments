\subsection{Handling of Vanacies on Board}

If an At-large Director seat becomes vacant, the seat shall be filled according to such processes determined by the Board of Directors, pursuant to the Bylaws and Policies of the Society.
When at-large seats are available for election for less than 12-months terms (due to vacancies arising part way through a term), an election shall first occur for the shorter term seats followed by an election for the one-year term seats.
If an at-large seat becomes temporarily inactive due to the holder becoming an Executive Officer, Council will be tasked to recommend a candidate to fill the position on a pro-tempore basis after publicising the vacancy.
