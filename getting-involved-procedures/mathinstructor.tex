Note: As outlined in the Guidelines for the Selection Committee for the University of Waterloo Distinguished Teacher Awards: The Distinguished Teacher Award has been set up by the Senate of the University of Waterloo in recognition of the great importance of excellence in teaching at all levels in the University. The award is open to all those who teach students in the University of Waterloo and its federated and affiliated colleges. Recipients are to be chosen from among nominees by a Selection Committee of faculty and students."

The Instructor of the Year Award has been set up by the Mathematics Society of the University of Waterloo in recognition of the importance of presentation when instructing within the Mathematics Faculty. The award is open to only those instructors of full courses within the Mathematics Faculty. Recipients are to be chosen from the recommendations of the Instructor of the year committee based on nominations by students within the Mathematics Faculty.

Honourable mentions are not meant to decrease the prestige of the Instructor of the Year Award.  They are intended to make the Award more respected and useful.  Honourable mentions should not be taken lightly and should be kept to as few as possible.

There are times when the IOY Committee, when allowed, would be tempted to give a tie or wind up making their decision based on small enough factors that the runners up are still worthy of recognition.  It is very possible that in other years these runners up could have won.  These are the situations that honourable mentions are meant for.
